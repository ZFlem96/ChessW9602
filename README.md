#  Chess Library
A simple Chess Library written in Java with the GUI written in Swings.

### The project is divided between three packages:
- 'Model' containing the core logic, the board setup and the test suite for the logic. 
- 'View' which contains an implementation of a static GUI. (Two JPanels representing the board and the pieces sitting on top of a JFrame)
- 'Controller' which connects the 'Model' and the 'View' [See the class variables, just one instance of Model and View each]
- The 'MVC' package has a single class called 'game'. Run the Main method in this file to launch the application (Such data abstraction). 

### Take a look at the fully detailed GUI test plan pdf in the 'GUI Test Plan' folder.
